# ScriptReader - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Reading scripts alone is challenging:
- Actors need to practice dialogue but have no scene partners available
- Timing and rhythm of conversations is lost when reading silently
- Hiring readers or coordinating schedules is impractical for regular practice
- Existing text-to-speech tools don't understand script structure or timing

### The Solution
ScriptReader acts as an intelligent scene partner that:
- Understands script format and character roles
- Listens to the human reader in real-time
- Responds with AI voices at the natural moment
- Creates an immersive, realistic practice experience

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

1. **Effortless Upload**
   - Drag and drop any script format
   - AI handles the parsing complexity
   - User sees clean, structured dialogue immediately

2. **Intuitive Role Assignment**
   - Clear visual of all characters
   - One-click to assign "I'll read this" vs "AI reads this"
   - Smart defaults suggested by AI

3. **Natural Performance Flow**
   - Teleprompter-style display
   - Visual indicator of current position
   - AI voices feel responsive, not robotic
   - No buttons to press during performance

4. **Forgiving & Flexible**
   - Handles imperfect reading (skipped words, paraphrasing)
   - Easy to resync if things go wrong
   - Edit mode to fix any parsing errors

### Key UX Principles
- **Mobile-first design** - Many users will practice on phones
- **Minimal setup friction** - Upload to performing in under 2 minutes
- **Clear visual feedback** - Always know what the app is doing
- **Graceful degradation** - Works with free APIs, better with premium
