# ScriptReader - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
ScriptReader is a smart script companion app for solo actors to practice with AI scene partners.

## Key Patterns & Preferences

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- PWA for cross-platform support

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks
- Separate concerns into custom hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data models

### File Organization
```
/src/app          - Pages and API routes
/src/components   - React components (ui/, script/, audio/)
/src/lib          - Utilities (parser/, speech/, store/)
/src/types        - TypeScript definitions
```

### API Key Handling
- User provides their own Anthropic API key
- Store in localStorage (user's responsibility)
- Pass through Next.js API routes

### Critical Implementation Notes
1. **Auto-Follow Engine** is the core feature - no manual tap to advance
2. Use Web Speech API for free tier, ElevenLabs for premium
3. Fuzzy matching needed for speech recognition (people don't read perfectly)
4. Silence detection threshold: start with 1.5-2 seconds

### Testing Approach
- Test speech recognition in Chrome first (best support)
- Mobile testing important (iOS Safari has audio restrictions)
- Use sample scripts for consistent testing

## Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```
